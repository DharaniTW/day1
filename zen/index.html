    <h1>What is http 1.1 ?</h1>
    <p>HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, 
        and it is the basis for almost all web applications. 
        More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information. 
        For instance, when someone navigates to google.com on their laptop, their web browser sends an HTTP request to the Google servers 
        for the content that appears on the page. Then, Google servers send HTTP responses with the text, images, and formatting that the browser displays to the user.
    </p>
    <h2>What is http 2 ?</h2>
    <p>In 2015, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) release HTTP/2, the second major version of the most useful internet protocol, HTTP. 
       It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol

    <h3>Advantages of http 2:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTTP/2 is binary, instead of textual meaning it is more compact, travels faster 'on the wire' and is less susceptible to errors</li>
        <li>Binary protocol</li>
        <li>HTTP 2 server push</li>
        <li>Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection</li>
        <li>Reuest pipelining</li>
        <li>HTTP 2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection</li>
    </ul>
